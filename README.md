FizzBuzz Kata
=============

This task was set by the end of week 1 whilst learning to code at Makers Academy.

It was my first encounter with test-driven development using RSpec.

#### Technologies used
+ Ruby
+ RSpec


#### Video
The purpose of this video is to record my best time doing FizzBuzz Kata. 

Although the recommended time is 5 minutes, at the time of recording, I only managed to get it down to 7:30 mins.
